	<p class="STORY">Hi, I’m Liz and I am super excited to share with the world my passion for incense burners and art! Our journey started in my garage. I built an art studio for my work in 2020. Since then, I’ve been exploring different kinds of mediums, such as natural clay. Once I got a feel for the material, I immediately fell in love! I started making random objects with the clay and just plopping them in every corner of the house. Then one day, I decided to light an incense cone while I was working that day. I was sculpting a head. Then as the aroma of the incense filled the room, I stopped and thought to myself; “why don’t I create my own incense burners!”. And so I did, and the rest is history. I initially made them for myself but then saw that people were actually interested in buying them! I then decided to launch a small business where I made custom orders for my friends and family. </p>

	<p class="STORY">It doesn't stop here. My brother, Nelson, who specializes in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, offered his skill to the company. (This is in the works, but) Nelson pitched the idea of mechanizing these burners to make the smoke blow out in certain patterns and shapes with tiny fans. He began planning for this and also teamed up with a colleague of his who would be able to mass produce these high-tech burners using 3D-printing. This is where our worlds collided. Never would I ever think of collaborating with my engineer brother. Our talents seemed like polar opposites but Incense Customs has inspired us to come together and create! </p>

	<p class="STORY">We appreciate all the love and support and look forward to showing you our new, high-tech incense burners *coming soon!*. For now, please feel free to look at our catalog of traditional incense burners.</p>
